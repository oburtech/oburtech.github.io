          and emotional energy to server maintenance, cybersecurity, networking,
          disaster recovery, technological evolutions… you get the idea.

          Information Technology began as a supporting function a million years

          Today, even organizations that don’t consider themselves “high-tech”
          must leverage IT as a core element of their future success. Which
          means they need IT strategists.

        <p class="description__text">
          IT strategists like Obur Tech generate an IT roadmap that aligns your
          business objectives with IT requirements, reviews the current state of
          your IT affairs, outlines your ideal future state, then defines the
          individual initiatives to get from “current” to “ideal.”
